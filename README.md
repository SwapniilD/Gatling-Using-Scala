Running Gatling Tests

1. Execute the Demo Test

Run the following command to execute the test:

mvn gatling:test

2. View Test Reports

After execution, Gatling generates a detailed HTML report in the target/gatling directory. Open the latest test report in a browser:

open target/gatling/<test-name>/index.html

Using Gatling Recorder

Gatling provides a built-in Recorder to capture HTTP requests and generate scripts automatically.

Run the Recorder:

mvn gatling:recorder

Configure the proxy settings and start recording your actions.

Stop the recording, and Gatling will generate a test script in the user-files/simulations directory.
